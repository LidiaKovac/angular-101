# Angular 101 ðŸ’½

Hi! My name is Lidia ðŸ‘‹

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! This repo is part of a "series" of 101s.

I am a MERN Stack developer and Teaching Assistant at EPICODE. I specialize in MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of autonomous research, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page.

This is the repository for the basics of creating an Angular Application. I followed EPICODE's lessons to create it.

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
