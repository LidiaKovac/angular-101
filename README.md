# Angular 101 🧑‍🔬

Hi! My name is Lidia 👋

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 

I am a MERN Stack developer and I am now trying to expand my tech stack by learning something new, Angular! 
This is mainly a white board for me to understand the very basics, since I already use a frontend library (React). 

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
